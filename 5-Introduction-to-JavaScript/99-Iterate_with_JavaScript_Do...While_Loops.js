//you can run the same code multiple times by using a loop. do while loops first will do one pass of the code inside the loop no matter what and then it runs while a specified condition is true and stops once that condition is no longer true

// Setup
var myArray = [];
var i = 10;

// Only change code below this line.

while (i < 5) {
  myArray.push(i);
  i++;
}
do {
myArray.push(i)
i++
}
while (i < 5);
