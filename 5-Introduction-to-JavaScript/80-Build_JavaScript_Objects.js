//objects are similar to arrays except that instead of using indexes they use properties. objects are useful for storing data in a structured way and can represent real world objects like a cat.

// Example
var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};

// Only change code below this line.

var myDog = {
  "name": "Ein",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["spike", "ed"]
};
